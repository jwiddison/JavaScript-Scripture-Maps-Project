HW 7 Widdison Jordan
Map Scriptures Project

For this homework, I feel like it was a really good continuation of the last homework.  I learned more about jslint and feel more
comfortable using it.  FYI, I use a default tab length of 2 spaces rather than 4, so if you run my javascript file against jslint,
it yells about absolutely everything.  However, if you turn off the whitespace setting, it passes with flying colors.
I feel like I'm gaining a better understanding of closures as I do these assignments, and the general idea of them,
as well as just a better feel for everything you can do in javascript as well.  There is a lot more power in javascript than I ever
realized in the past.  I'm learning more keyboard shortcuts and more efficient ways to use my editor (atom) as I try and keep up with
you using vim.  Almost thou convicest me to use vim.  Almost.  I learned that I really prefer the way python lets you concatenate strings
together (Putting %s in pace of every string variable you want to include, and making a list of them at the end, and using '' around
the string, so "" inside don't have to be escaped.)  That was probably the most frustrating part of the assignment for me.  Dealing
with the messy concatenated JavaScript strings.  Overall, I think its a great assignment to get a feel for the power of JavaScript.
I've been understanding things as we've talked about them in class, but its cool to see them in action as well.
