IS 542 Project 2 Widdison Jordan
JavaScript Map Scriptures Project

Hosted at:  542homework.jordanwiddison.com

This was a fun project to work on.  Its really my first time diving into developing something in JavaScript on my own.  Following along with the
videos up to this point was helpful, but I found this to be an even more helpful learning experience.  JavaScript is really a lot
more powerful of a language than I ever gave it credit for being.  I learned a lot about what you can do, and gained a deeper appreciation
for how much power there really is at your disposal when developing in JavaScript.

TODO: Finish writing the README
