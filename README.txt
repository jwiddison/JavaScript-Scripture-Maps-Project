IS 542 Project 2 Widdison Jordan
JavaScript Map Scriptures Project

Hosted at:  542homework.jordanwiddison.com

This was a fun project to work on.  Its really my first time diving into developing something in JavaScript on my own.  Following along with the
videos up to this point was helpful, but I found this to be an even more helpful learning experience.  JavaScript is really a lot
more powerful of a language than I ever gave it credit for being.  I learned a lot about what you can do, and gained a deeper appreciation
for how much power there really is at your disposal when developing in JavaScript.  I also am gaining more understanding of good ways to
debug through the console/inspector in chrome.  There is a LOT of power there that I never realized was there before.  I'm also learning more
about how to handle asynchronous tasks.  Waiting for one function to finish, setting timeouts, using callbacks, etc.  It really is a useful thing
to understand when you realize that you can't thread things in JavaScript (that I know of).  I'm really starting to appreciate everything that you can
do with JavaScript.  My code isn't very clean (JSLint wouldn't approve at all).  If I had more time, I would have liked to spend more time refactoring
and making things a little more robust.  Given how busy this week has been, its been about getting the project finished and working, rather
than getting it perfect.

I noticed the edit place requirement about 20 minutes before this was due, so I didn't have time to make the edit button show/hide.  Thats
what I would work on next if I had more time.

Notes from getting feedback:
----------------------------

I showed the application to my wife.  She is my designated UI/UX tester.  One feature she thought it would be cool to add would be if you
hovered over a geocoded place name, to have the pin grow in size or change color.  So that without clicking and zooming into a particular
point you can see all the locations in relation to each other.  She also thought it would be cool to have them highlight dynamically as you
scroll through the verses.  Those would be really awesome features to implement, but given the approaching deadline for submitting this
assignment, that will have to be for another sprint.
